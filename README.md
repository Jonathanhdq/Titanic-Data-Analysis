# Titanic-Data-Analysis
## Synopsis
This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree in which the task was to investigate and analyze one of Udacity's curated datasets. This will take us through the various steps in the data analysis process: 1) Posing the Questions, 2) Data Wrangling, 3) Data Exploration, 4) Draw Conclusions and 5) Communicate the Findings (Not included). As this is an introductory project, advanced techniques such as machine learning are not used to draw conclusions, thus, all findings are tentative. 

## Details
This project was done on a Jupyter Notebook using a combination of Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib, thus, it is recommended that you install Anaconda which comes with all the necessary packages. A Python 2 environment will work well when opening this project.
